  <h1>My Bloody Valentine</h1>
  <p>  My Bloody Valentine are a rock band formed in Dublin in 1983. Since 1987, the band's lineup has consisted of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar, sampler) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums, sampler), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their music is best known for its blend of dissonant guitar textures with ethereal melody and unorthodox production techniques, and helped to pioneer the genre known as shoegazing during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

  <p>Following several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released a number of successful EPs, including You Made Me Realise (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991), and two studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991), with the latter often described as the band's magnum opus and one of the best albums of the 1990s. However, the band were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive. Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995, the group disbanded in 1997.</p>

 <p> In 2007, Shields announced My Bloody Valentine had reformed and the band subsequently toured across Europe, Asia and North America. Following reissues of both Isn't Anything and Loveless, and the release of the compilation album EP's 1988–1991 (2012), My Bloody Valentine's long-delayed third studio album, m b v, was released on 2 February 2013, 22 years after the release of their last full-length album.</p>

  <p>My Bloody Valentine are regarded by some as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by Sounds journalists in the 1990 to describe certain bands' "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".The band's releases on Creation Records influenced shoegazing acts, including Slowdive, Ride and Lush, and are regarded as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised.Following the release of Loveless (1991), My Bloody Valentine were "poised for a popular breakthrough", although never achieved mainstream success. However, the band are noted to have been "profoundly influential in the direction of '90s alternative rock", according to AllMusic.In 2017, a study of AllMusic's database indicated My Bloody Valentine as its 26th most frequently cited influence on other artists.

  <p> Isn't Anything was included in The Guardian's list of "1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die" and listed at number 22 on Pitchfork's "Top 100 Albums of the 1980s." Loveless was named the best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork in 1999 and in 2003, the album was listed as number 219 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
